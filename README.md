# Web-Scraping-Project

Project Overview
This project is a simple web scraper that extracts data from a website using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries in Python. The data is primarily focused on extracting table data from the HTML of the website. Once extracted, the data is processed and stored in a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation. Finally, the processed data is saved as a CSV file in an output folder.
